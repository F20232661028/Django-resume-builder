# Resume Template Design Note

**Design Inspiration:**
This resume template was inspired by modern, minimalistic professional CVs that prioritize clarity and readability. The layout uses clear section headings, generous white space, and a single-column format to ensure the content is easy to scan both on screen and in print. The use of semantic HTML5 elements helps with accessibility and structure.

**Fonts and Colors:**
The template uses the 'Roboto' font from Google Fonts for a clean, contemporary look, with Arial and sans-serif as fallbacks. The color palette is intentionally minimal: black and dark gray for text, with a subtle green (#198754) accent for section headers and highlights. This ensures excellent print contrast and a professional appearance.

**Unique Elements:**
The template features a responsive design using CSS flexbox, so it adapts well to different screen sizes. Section headers have a colored border for visual hierarchy. Skills are displayed as pill-shaped tags for a modern touch. The template is fully print-optimized for A4 paper and tested with WeasyPrint for PDF export.
